# JNotei

JNotei is a full-stack Notion clone built with a modern tech stack including Next.js, React, TypeScript, ShardCn UI, and Convex database. Fully Responsive for all devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building JavaScript applications. It enables features like server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It helps to write code that is more understandable and less prone to runtime errors.

- **ShardCn UI:** A UI library for building high-quality, customizable, and responsive web layouts and components.

- **Convex Database:** A database used for managing application data. It provides features like data persistence, querying, and transactions.

## Project Overview

JNotei is a comprehensive project that aims to replicate the functionality of Notion. It allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes in a user-friendly interface. The application is built with a focus on responsiveness and performance, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices and network conditions.

The project is structured following best practices for full-stack development, with a clear separation between the front-end and back-end responsibilities. The front-end is built with Next.js, React, and ShardCn UI for a dynamic and interactive UI. TypeScript is used to ensure type safety and improve the development experience.

The back-end is powered by the Convex database, providing reliable data management capabilities. The application data is stored and retrieved efficiently, ensuring high performance even with large amounts of data.

This project is a great example of a modern full-stack application and can serve as a reference for building similar applications.
